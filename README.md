# 🎯 Project Goals
Various database operations are introduced in this project. A menu is viewed where each number from 1 to 4 leads to viewing different operations.
In this exercise created a dynamic script where the user gets to choose a data type and perform related operations. 

# 🌟 Project Overview
   - Prompts the user to select a data type from a list of choices.
   - Based on the user’s selection, performs specific operations related to that data type.
   - Provides meaningful output and handles edge cases (like dividing by zero or modifying an immutable type).
   - This project is designed to give you hands-on experience with fundamental Python concepts while making it fun and interactive! 💡

# 🛠 Solution
   - String manipulation 🧵
   - Basic arithmetic and number handling ➕➖✖️➗
   - Boolean logic 🤔 (AND, OR, NOT)
   - Working with lists, tuples, and dictionaries 📋🗂️
   - Error handling 🚫
   - User input & output 🖥️
